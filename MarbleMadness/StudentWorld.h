/*
 Add any private data members to this class required to keep track of
 walls as well as the Avatar object. You may ignore all other items in
 the maze such as RageBots, the exit, etc. for part #1.
 ii. Implement a constructor for this class that initializes your data
 members.
 iii. Implement a destructor for this class that frees any remaining
 dynamically allocated data that has not yet been freed at the time the
 StudentWorld object is destroyed.
 iv. Implement the init() method in this class. It must create the player and
 insert it into the maze at the right starting location (see the Level class
 section of this document for details on the starting location). It must
 also create all of the Walls and add them to the maze as specified in
 the current Levelâ€™s data file.
 v. Implement the move() method in your StudentWorld class. During
 each tick, it must ask your Avatar and walls to do something. Your
 move() method need not check to see if the player has died or not; you
 may assume at this point that the player cannot die. Your move()
 method does not have to deal with any actors other than the player and
 the Walls.
 vi. Implement a cleanup() method that frees any dynamically allocated
 data that was allocated during calls to the init() method or the move()
 method (e.g., it should delete all your allocated Walls and the player).
 Note: Your StudentWorld class must have both a destructor and the
 cleanUp() method even though they likely do the same thing (in which
 case the destructor could just call cleanup()).
